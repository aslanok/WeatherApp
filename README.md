# WeatherApp
WeatherApp with API

This app is written with instructor Angela Yu. While I am develoing this app I learned : 
- Working with APIs
- MVC Design Patterns
- Dark/Light Mode Change
- CLLocation

Dark Mode ON              |  Dark Mode OFF

When user pressed Location Button, user will see weather results according to city which user is locating. This feature developed with CLLocation.

Also, I learned how should I use gitignore file while I developing this app. I hide my API Key in Constants.swift file and I put this file to .gitignore .
